# Reef Projects I Built

Hey there! 👋🏼

I am Anukul Pandey, Final Year Undergrad . A penetration tester, Web developer & also an App developer. I like to build stuff , or BUIDL 🙂

So here are the projects I made on Reef chain, from the most basic ones to the recent ones. I hope you will like them! Without further a do. Let’s get started!

- Monkey Share 🐒
    
    This is the first dapp I ever made, here user can come , pay a one time fee of registration on the service & after that they can use unlimited free file storage services of IPFS.

    It has an easy to use interface. You can read more about this by visiting the link below 🙂

- Pocket Monster 🦖
    
    One of the best Dapp I ever made 😀. Or maybe the first game on the Reef chain as well. So here you have to connect your wallet, select one of the characters . PS: There is no strongest or weakest character, your chances of winning depends on various criterias. Like the time in which you select that character, the actual strength of character & so on.

- Token Sender 🦊
    
    I use reef’s extension a lot while development as well as in the production (ofc) but I had a problem of sending Reef tokens from one account to another, as I have multiple accounts for testing purpose. So what did I do? I built a DAPP specifically for sending Reef tokens from one account to another 😎 & the transaction fee per transaction is just 1.51 Reefs.

### Utility Stuff

Apart from full stack dapps, I wrote some scripts, or made some repositories , which might be helpful for other developers, specially for those who are just starting to develop on the Reef chain.

💡 PS: There were few problems which I encountered while learning so I am also providing the solutions I came up with 🙂

- Minimal Reef React Dapp
    
    There are lots of minimal dapps variants of Reef chain are available , but they were not written in pure react js & to be really honest most of the developers are familiar with javascript , more than typescript. And as a beginner when someone tries to use @reef-defi/evm-provider they might encounter few errors which are not available on the internet like adding polyfills, resolving crypto browser errors and so on. So I built this dapp which consists of all the libraries & modules which a developer might require to start building on reef chain.

    Kind of a starter template for reef react dapp
    
    Repository url : https://github.com/anukulpandey/minimal-react-reef-dapp
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anukulpandey/minimal-react-reef-dapp project
    cd project
    yarn install 
    yarn start
    ```
    
- Minimal Reef Hardhat
    
    A basic reef hardhat project (TYPICAL HELLO WORLD) but in the world of web3 🙂
    
    Serves as a template in my day to day development work.
